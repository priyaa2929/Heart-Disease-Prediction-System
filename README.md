#Algorithms Used:
#k-Nearest Neighbors:
The k-NN algorithm is arguably the simplest machine learning algorithm. Building the model consists only of storing the training data set. To make a prediction for a new data point, the algorithm finds the closest data points in the training data set, its “nearest neighbors.”
The accuracy score achieved using KNN is: 67.21 %

To further improve the model, feature selection and engineering techniques can be applied to identify the most important features for predicting heart disease. This can lead to more accurate models with better generalization. Additionally, hyperparameter tuning can be performed to optimize the model performance.
Furthermore, exploring other machine learning algorithms or ensemble methods like Gradient Boosting or Neural Networks can also improve the accuracy of the model. Finally, the model can be deployed as a web application or mobile application for easy access and use by healthcare professionals or individuals.

The future scope of a heart disease prediction system using machine learning is vast and promising. Some potential areas of development and advancement include:

1. Integration with wearable technology: With the increasing popularity of wearable devices such as smartwatches and fitness trackers, integrating a heart disease prediction system with these devices can provide real-time monitoring and early detection of heart disease. This can allow for timely intervention and preventive care, improving patient outcomes.

2. Use of advanced machine learning algorithms: While the current models used in heart disease prediction are effective, there is scope for further improvement using more advanced machine learning algorithms. For example, deep learning models such as neural networks can be used to capture more complex relationships between the features and the target variable, leading to more accurate predictions.

3. Personalized risk assessment: Machine learning algorithms can be used to develop personalized risk assessment models based on the individual's medical history, lifestyle, and other relevant information. This can provide more accurate risk estimates and tailored treatment recommendations.

4. Integration with electronic health records (EHRs): Integrating the heart disease prediction system with EHRs can provide a comprehensive view of the patient's medical history, allowing for more accurate risk assessment and treatment planning.

5. Mobile application development: Developing a mobile application for heart disease prediction can improve access to healthcare services, especially in rural or remote areas where healthcare facilities are limited. This can provide early detection and intervention for heart disease, reducing healthcare costs and improving patient outcomes.

Overall, the future of heart disease prediction using machine learning is promising, and there is ample scope for development and advancement. With further research and development, these systems can become an essential tool in preventive care and personalized treatment planning.
