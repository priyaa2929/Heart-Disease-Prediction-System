# Heart-Disease-Prediction-System

The aim of this project is to implement the heart disease prediction application. Many people all over
the world nearly 60% of the worldâ€™s population are now-a-days suffering from heart disease. Heart Disease
Prediction system is an android application which helps the users for the easy prediction, prevention and curing of
the disease. An android application gets the disease name as the output based on the data provided by the user or
patient. Android application is also used to get the preventive measures like nearby doctor details, hospitals details
and location for hospitals. Proposed system consists of an intelligent system which works on the machine learning
algorithms like KNN. The data entered by the user is compared with some existing standard datasets to get
probability. KNN used to find the probability.
KEYWORDS - Users, KNN, Probability. 




Dataset Description
The heart data set originated from Kaggle website, which contains medical information of patients, including their
1. age
2. sex
3. chest pain type (4 values)
4. resting blood pressure
5. serum cholestoral in mg/dl
6. fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl
7. resting electrocardiographic results (values 0,1,2)
8. maximum heart rate achieved
9. exercise induced angina
10. oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
11. the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
12. number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy
13. thal: 0 = normal; 1 = fixed defect; 2 = reversable defect The names and social security numbers of the patients were recently removed from the database, replaced with dummy values.
We performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the dataset to gain insights into the data and visualize the distribution of the features. We then split the data into training and testing sets. Heart dataset containing 303 cases. The objective is to predict based on the measures to predict if the patient is diabetic or not.
